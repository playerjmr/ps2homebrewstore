About PicoDrive
---------------

This is yet another SEGA 8 bit and 16 bit console emulator.

It can run games developed for most consumer hardware released
by SEGA, up to and including the 32X:
- **16 bit systems:** Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega/Mega CD, 32X, Pico
- **8 bit systems**: SG-1000, SC-3000, Master System/Mark III, Game Gear

PicoDrive was originally created with ARM-based handheld devices
in mind, but later received various cross-platform improvements
such as SH2 recompilers for MIPS (mips32r2), ARM64 (armv8), RISC-V (RV64IM)
and PowerPC (G4/2.03).

PicoDrive was the first software to properly emulate Virtua Racing and
its SVP chip.

At present, most development activity occurs in
[irixxxx's fork](https://github.com/irixxxx/picodrive);
[notaz's repo](https://github.com/notaz/picodrive) is updated less frequently.

### Using MSU, MD+/32X+, and Mode 1 on Sega/Mega CD

PicoDrive supports using CD audio enhanced cartridge games in all 3 formats.
To start an enhanced cartridge, load the .cue or .chd file. The cartridge
file should have the same base name and be placed in the same directory.
Further instructions can be found in `platform/base_readme.txt`.

### Sega Pico and Storyware Pages

PicoDrive can use Storyware pages and pad overlays in png format in the same
directory as the cartridge image. The selected page is displayed automatically
if the pen is used on the storyware or pad. Details about how to correctly name
the pages can be found in `platform/base_readme.txt`.

### Sega Pico Pen and Sega Mouse

On all platforms with physical mouse support, PicoDrive can use real mouse
input to emulate a Sega Mouse or the Pico Pen. A physical mouse can be operated
in either a captured or uncaptured state, selectable via the `Capture mouse`
hotkey. Mouse mode can be activated by setting `mouse` as the input device for
one of the pads. It depends on the game as to which pad should be used for mouse
input. More information is located in `platform/base_readme.txt`.

### Sega Menacer and Light Phaser and Konami Justifier

PicoDrive can use a physical mouse for light gun emulation on all platforms
with mouse support. This can be activated by selecting an input device of
either `light gun` or `justifier`. The `light gun` setting represents the Sega
Menacer for the Mega Drive or the Light Phaser for the Master System; it may
be attached to either pad input port. The `justifier` is only available on
input 2. Supplementary information is provided in `platform/base_readme.txt`.

### Sega Pico and SC-3000 Keyboards

PicoDrive provides support for the Pico and SC-3000 keyboards. This can be
enabled in the `Controls` configuration menu. Once enabled, keyboard input may
be activated via the `Keyboard` emulator hotkey.

Both physical keyboard support and a virtual keyboard overlay are available.
Physical keyboards are assigned a default key mapping corresponding to an
American PC layout, but the mapping can be redefined in the `Controls`
configuration menu. Note that only 'unmodified' physical key presses (e.g.
`a`, `1` etc) can be mapped to emulated keyboard input; special characters
entered via modifier/meta keys (e.g. `Ctrl`, `Shift` etc) will not work.
Additional information may be found in `platform/base_readme.txt`.

### Sega SC-3000 Cassette Drive

In addition to keyboard support, PicoDrive emulates the SC-3000 cassette tape
drive which may be used in conjunction with BASIC cartridges. Tape emulation
includes an automatic start/stop feature, where the tape is only advanced when
it is accessed by the SC-3000; manual pausing of the tape is unnecessary for
multi-part loading or saving.

PicoDrive supports tape files in `WAV` and `bitstream` format.

### Compiling

For platforms where release builds are provided, the simplest method is to
use the release script `tools/release.sh`. See the script itself for details.
To create platform builds run the command:

```
tools/release.sh [version] [platforms...]
```

This will generate a file for each platform in the `release-[version]` directory.
A list of supported platforms can be found in the release script.

These commands should create an executable for a unixoid platform not included in the list:

```
configure --platform=generic
make
```

To compile PicoDrive as a libretro core, use this command:

```
make -f Makefile.libretro
```

### Helix MP3 decoder for ARM

For 32 bit ARM platforms, the optimized helix MP3 decoder can be used to play
MP3 audio files with CD games. Due to licensing issues, the helix source files
cannot be provided here; if you have obtained the sources legally, place them in
the `platform/common/helix` directory.

To compile the helix sources:

- Set the environment variable `CROSS_COMPILE` to your cross compiler prefix
(e.g. `arm-linux-gnueabi-`)
- Set the environment variable `LIBGCC` to your cross compiler's `libgcc.a`
(e.g. `/usr/lib/gcc-cross/arm-linux-gnueabi/4.7/libgcc.a`)
- Run the command:
```
make -C platform/common/helix CROSS_COMPILE=$CROSS_COMPILE LIBGCC=$LIBGCC
```
- Copy the resulting shared library named `${CROSS_COMPILE}helix_mp3.so` as
`libhelix.so` to the directory containing the PicoDrive binary on the target device.

In addition, helix support must be enabled in PicoDrive itself by compiling with:

```
make PLATFORM_MP3=1
```

This switch is enabled automatically for Gamepark Holdings devices (`gp2x`,
`caanoo` and `wiz`). Without installing `libhelix.so`, these devices will not play
MP3 audio.

### Installing

The release script produces packages or zip archives which have to be installed
manually on the target device. Usually this involves unpacking the archive or
copying the package to a directory on either the internal device storage or an
SD card. Device-specific instructions can be found on the internet.

How to make it run
------------------


Then load a ROM and enjoy! Cartridge ROMs can be in various common formats and
can be zipped, one ROM file per zip. Certain extensions are used to detect the
console the ROM is for (.sg, .sc, .sms, .gg, .smd, .md, .gen, .32x, .pco).
For MSU or MD+ games, load the .cue file and make sure the cartridge ROM has the
same name and is in the same directory. MD+ use extensions in the .cue file,
hence don't try to convert it to any other format.
Sega/Mega CD images can be in CHD, CUE+BIN/ISO or ISO/CSO+MP3/WAV format (read
below for more details).

This emulator has lots of options with various tweaks (for improved speed mostly),
but it should have best compatibility in it's default config. If suddenly you
start getting glitches or change something and forget what, use "Restore defaults"
option.


How to run Sega/Mega CD games
-----------------------------

To play any non-MSU/MD+ CD game you need BIOS files. These must be copied to
the same directory as PicoDrive files.
Files must be named as follows:

US: us_scd1_9210.bin, us_scd2_9306.bin, SegaCDBIOS9303.bin
EU: eu_mcd1_9210.bin, eu_mcd2_9303.bin, eu_mcd2_9306.bin
JP: jp_mcd1_9112.bin, jp_mcd1_9111.bin
these files can also be zipped.

The game must be dumped to CHD, CUE+BIN or CUE+ISO format.
ISO/CSO+MP3/WAV is also supported, but may cause problems.
When using CUE/BIN, you must load .cue file from the menu, or else the emu will
not find audio tracks.


How to run Sega Pico games
--------------------------

The Pico was special in that it had a large touchpad with an associated pen, and
so-called storyware, a combination of a cartridge with a book with up to 6 pages
on which the pen could also be used.

Most storywares used the touchpad with the pen as a pointer device, showing a
pointer icon on the screen when the pen was on the touchpad which could be moved
around. The pen has a dedicated button which was often used to select something
under the pointer icon, much like a mouse button.
However, a few games also had an overlay for the touchpad.

PicoDrive supports displaying both the storyware pages as well as a pad overlay.
They must be in png format and named like the storyware ROM without the
extension, plus "_<n>.png" for the storyware page <n>, and "_pad.png" for a pad
overlay. Storyware page images should have an aspect ration of 2:1, pad images
should have 4:3. All images can have arbitrary resolution and are automatically
scaled to fit the screen.

There are 2 menu actions for switching to pages or pad which will automatically
display the images if they are available. To allow for proper pen positioning
there is also a function for having the pen on the page/touchpad or not, the
toggle for which is mapped to the START pad button. Pen positioning is done
through the D-pad if the screen has been switched to either pages or pad, or by
mouse if physical mouse support is activated.


How to use keyboard input
-------------------------

Both the SC-3000 and the Sega Pico support keyboard input. To activate keyboard
input in PicoDrive, press the "Switch keyboard" emulator hotkey while running
a cartridge with keyboard support. Depending on the keyboard configuration
settings, either the physical or the virtual keyboard can be used.

If the physical keyboard is configured, activating the keyboard will switch off
all other hotkeys as well as pad functions. All keyboard input is routed to
the emulated keyboard, as configured in the physical keyboard mapping.

The virtual keyboard displays an overlay when activated. The currently selected
key is highlighted, and the selection can be changed with the left, right, up,
and down keys. Pressing the A button will send the selected key to the emulated
keyboard. Pressing B will show what the key value would be if the emulated Shift
key is active. The C button will move the keyboard overlay from the top of the
screen to the bottom and vice versa.

All meta keys, like Shift, Ctrl, have a built-in toggle function. Pressing the
A button on them will toggle their state between pressed and released. Depending
on the state the color of the key changes slightly. Only one meta key can be
active at the same time.


How to load SC-3000 tapes
-------------------------

The SC-3000 microcomputer has a connector for attaching a cassette tape drive.
PicoDrive supports tape recordings in WAV or bitstream format. Run one of the
BASIC cartridges then load the tape image via the `Load tape` menu. Entering
the `LOAD` command using the emulated keyboard automatically starts the virtual
tape drive. Confirmation will usually be provided after the tape has been read.

The virtual tape drive has an automatic start/stop feature. Tapes requiring
several load operations are handled without the need for user intervention.


Other important stuff
---------------------

* Sega/Mega CD: If the background music is missing, the CD image format may be
  wrong. Currently .cue/bin or .chd is recommended. Be aware that there are
  lots of bad dumps on the web, and some use mp3 format for audio, which often
  causes problems (see below).
* While iso/mp3 format is supported, it's not recommended to use.
  Some of many problems with mp3 are listed below:
  * MP3s may be named incorrectly and will not play.
  * The game music may play too fast/too slow/out of sync, which means they
    are encoded incorrectly. PicoDrive is not a mp3 player, so all mp3s MUST
    be encoded at 44.1kHz stereo.
* Sega/Mega CD: If your games hang at the BIOS screen (with planets shown),
  you may be using a bad BIOS dump. Try another from a different source,
  like dumping it from your own console.


Options
-------

1. "Region"
This option lets you force the game to think it is running on machine from the
specified region, or just to set autodetection order. Also affects Sega/Mega CD.

2. "Hotkey save/load slot"
This is a slot number to use for savestates, when done by a button press outside
menu. This can also be configured to be changed with a button
(see "Key configuration").

3. "Interface options"
Enters Interface options menu (see below).

4. "Display options"
Enters Display options menu (see below).

5. "Sound options"
Enters Sound options menu (see below).

6. "MD/Genesis/Pico options"
Enters Mega Drive/Genesis/Pico options menu (see below).

7. "Sega/Mega CD add-on"
Enters Sega/Mega CD options menu (see below).

8. "32X add-on"
Enters 32X options menu (see below).

9. "SG/SMS/GG options"
Enters SG-1000/SC-3000/Master System/Game Gear options menu (see below).

10. "Advanced options"
Enters advanced options menu (see below).

11. "Restore defaults"
Restores all options (except controls) to defaults.


Interface options
-----------------

1. "Save global options"
If you save your config here it will be loaded on next ROM load, but only if
there is no game specific config saved (which will be loaded in that case).
You can press left/right to switch to a different config profile.

2. "Save game options"
Whenever you load current ROM again these settings will be loaded.

3. "Show FPS"
Self-explanatory. Format is XX/YY, where XX is the number of rendered frames and
YY is the number of emulated frames per second.

4. "Confirm save/load"
Allows to enable confirmation on saving (to prevent savestate overwrites), on
loading (to prevent destroying current game progress), and on both or none, when
using shortcut buttons (not menu) for saving/loading.

5. "Don't save last used ROM"
This will disable writing last used ROM to config on exit (what might cause SD
card corruption according to DaveC).


Display options
---------------

1. "Frameskip"
How many frames to skip rendering before displaying another.
"Auto" is recommended.

2. "Max auto frameskip"
How many frames to skip rendering at most if Frameskip is "Auto".



Sound options
-------------

1. "Enable sound"
Does what it says.

2. "Sound Quality"
Sound sample rate and stereo mode. Lower rates improve performance but sound
quality is lower.

3. "Sound filter"
Enables a low pass filter, similar to filtering in the real Mega Drive hardware.

4. "Filter strength"
Controls the sound filter. Higher values have more impact.


Mega Drive/Genesis/Pico options
-------------------------------

1. "Renderer"

2. "FM audio"
This enables emulation of six-channel FM sound synthesizer chip, which was used
to produce sound effects and music.

3. "FM filter"
This filter makes the sound output more accurate, but it is slower, especially
for lower sound rates.

4. "FM DAC noise"
Makes the sound output more like a first model Mega Drive/Genesis if enabled.
Later models had an improved FM chip without the DAC noise.


Sega/Mega CD add-on
-------------------

1. "Save RAM cart"
Here you can enable 64K RAM cart. Format it in BIOS if you do.

2. "CD LEDs"
The Sega/Mega CD unit had two blinking LEDs (red and green) on it. This option
will display them on top-left corner of the screen.

3. "CDDA audio"
This option enables CD audio playback.

4. "PCM audio"
This enables 8 channel PCM sound source. It is required for some games to run,
because they monitor state of this audio chip.


32X add-on
----------

1. "32X renderer"
This currently only affects how the Genesis/MD layers are rendered, which is
same as "Renderer" in display options.

2. "PWM audio"
Emulates PWM sound portion of 32X hardware. Disabling this may greatly improve
performance for games that dedicate one of SD2s for sound, but will cause
missing sound effects and instruments.

3. "PWM IRQ optimization"
Enabling this may improve performance, but may also introduce sound glitches.


SG/Master System/Game Gear options
----------------------------------

1. "System"
Selects which of the Sega 8 bit systems is emulated. "auto" is recommended.

2. "Cartridge mapping"
Some cartridges have hardware to enable additional capabilities, e.g. mapping
excess ROM storage or acessing a battery backed RAM storage. "auto" is
recommended, but in some rare cases it may be needed to manually select this.

3. "Game Gear LCD ghosting"
The Game Gear LCD display had a very noticeable inertia for image changes. This
setting enables emulating the effect, with "weak" being recommended.

4. "FM sound unit"
The Japanese Master System (aka Mark III) has an extension slot for an FM sound
unit. Some games made use of this for providing better music and effects.
Disabling this improves performance for games using the FM unit, and usually
means falling back to the non-FM sound.

5. "SMS palette in TMS modes"
The Master System graphics chip can emulate the TMS grafic modes used in MSX and
SG-1000 games, but it is using a color palette which is much darker and the
colours aren't a good match. This option uses the original color palette of the
TMS graphics chip, which gives better results for MSX/SG-1000 ports.

Advanced options
----------------

1. "Disable frame limiter"
This allows games to run faster then 50/60fps, useful for benchmarking.

2. "Disable sprite limit"
The Mega Drive/Genesis had a limit on how many sprites (usually smaller moving
objects) can be displayed on single line. This option allows to disable that
limit. Note that some games used this to hide unwanted things, so it is not
always good to enable this option.

3. "Disable idle loop patching"
Idle loop patching is used to improve performance, but may cause compatibility
problems in some rare cases. Try disabling this if your game has problems.

4. "Emulate Game Gear LCD"
Disabling this option displays the full Game Gear VDP image with the normally
invisible borders.

5. "Enable dynarecs"
This enables dynamic recompilation for SH2 and SVP CPU code, which is improving
emulation performance greatly. SVP dynarec is only available on 32 bit ARM CPUs.

6. "Master SH2 cycles" / "Slave SH2 cycles"
This allows underclocking the 32X CPUs for better emulation performance. The
number has the same meaning as cycles in DOSBox, which is cycles per millisecond.
Underclocking too much may cause various in-game glitches.


Key configuration
-----------------

Select "Configure controls" from the options menu. The "Player <n>" entry allows
for selecting a player with the left/right buttons. Then selecting "Player <n>"
will display 2 columns. The left column lists names of Genesis/MD controller
buttons, the right column shows which key on your handheld is assigned to it.

There is also option to enable 6 button pads (will allow you to configure XYZ
buttons), and an option to set turbo rate (in Hz) for turbo buttons.

Players 3 and 4 can only be used if a 4 player adapter is selected for input
device 1, and the game is supporting this. Only 3 button pads are currently
supported in 4 player mode.


Keyboard configuration
----------------------

The SC-3000 and the Sega Pico can use a keyboard as input device. Select
"Configure controls" to configure keyboard support in PicoDrive. The "Keyboard"
entry allows choosing the keyboard type by using the left/right buttons. The
virtual keyboard doesn't need any configuration. For configuring the physical
keyboard mapping, select "Keyboard" when the physical keyboard is selected.

Physical host keyboard keys are mapped 1:1 on emulated keyboard keys. Only the
unmodified base keys (like A, 1 etc) can be mapped. Don't use Shift, Ctrl or
Alt when changing the mapping, as it won't work. The default mapping matches
a standard American PC104 keyboard.


Cheat support
-------------

To use GG/patch codes, you must type them into your favorite text editor, one
per line. Comments may follow code after a whitespace. Only GameGenie and
Genecyst patch formats are supported.
Examples:

Genecyst patch (this example is for Sonic):

00334A:0005 Start with five lives
012D24:0001 Keep invincibility until end of stage
009C76:5478 each ring worth 2
009C76:5678 each ring worth 3
...

Game Genie patch (for Sonic 2):

ACLA-ATD4 Hidden palace instead of death egg in level select
...

Both GG and patch codes can be mixed in one file.

When the file is ready, name it just like your ROM file, but with additional
.pat extension, making sure that case matches.

Examples:

ROM: Sonic.zip
PATCH FILE: Sonic.zip.pat

ROM: Sonic 2.bin
PATCH FILE: Sonic 2.bin.pat

Put the file into your ROMs directory. Then load the .pat file as you would
a ROM. Then Cheat Menu Option should appear in main menu.

Problems / limitations
----------------------

* Various VDP modes and quirks (window bug, scroll size 2, etc.) are not
  perfectly emulated, as very few games use this (if any at all).
* The emulator is designed for speed and not 100% accurate, so some things may
  not work as expected.
* The FM sound core doesn't support all features and has some accuracy issues.

    (Lemmings, etc).
  + Added serial EEPROM SRAM support (Wonder Boy in Monster World,
    Megaman - The Wily Wars and many EA sports games like NBA Jam).
  + Implemented ROM banking for Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers
  * Updated to the latest version of DrZ80 core, integrated memory handlers
    in it for better performance. A noticeable performance increase, but save
	states may not work from the previous version (you can only use them with
	sound disabled in that case).
  + SRAM word read handler was using incorrect byte order, fixed.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0086:
  + Added missing CHK opcode handler (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode handler (Gargoyles,Bubba N Stix,...). As in real genesis,
    memory write-back phase is ignored (but can be enabled in config.h if needed).
  + Added missing NBCD and TRAPV opcode handlers.
  + Added missing addressing mode for CMP/EOR.
  + Added some minor optimizations.
  - Removed 216 handlers for 2927 opcodes which were generated for invalid addressing modes.
  + Fixed flags for ASL, NEG, NEGX, DIVU, ADDX, SUBX, ROXR.
  + Bugs fixed in MOVEP, LINK, ADDQ, DIVS handlers.
  * Undocumented flags for CHK, ABCD, SBCD and NBCD are now emulated the same way as in Musashi.
  + Added Uninitialized Interrupt emulation.
  + Altered timing for about half of opcodes to match Musashi's.

0.80
  * Nearly all VDP code was rewritten in ARM asm. Gives ~10-25% performance
    increase (depends on game).
  * Optimized 32-column renderer not to render tiles offscreen, games which
    use 32-column display (like Shining Force) run ~50% faster.
  + Added new "Alternative renderer", which gives another ~30-45% performance
    increase (in addition to mentioned above), but works only with some games,
    because it is missing some features (it uses tile-based rendering
    instead of default line-based and disables H-ints).
  + Added "fit2" display mode for all FC gamers. It always uses 208x146 for
    P800 and 208x208 for all other phones.
  + Added volume control for Motorolas (experimental).

  VDP changes:
  + Added support for vertical window (used by Vapor Trail, Mercs, GRIND
    Stormer and others).
  + Added sprite masking (hiding), adds some speed.
  + Added preliminary H counter emulation. Comix Zone and Sonic 3D Blast
    special stage are now playable.
  + Added column based vertical scrolling (Gunstar Heroes battleship level,
    Sonic and Knuckles lava boss, etc).

  Emulation changes:
  + Re-added and improved Z80 faking when Z80 is disabled. Many games now can
    be played without enabling Z80 (Lost Vikings, Syndicate, etc), but some
    still need it (International Superstar Soccer Deluxe).
  * Improved ym2612 timers, Outrun music plays at correct speed, voices in
    Earthworm Jim play better, more games play sound.
  * I/O registers now remember their values (needed for Pirates! Gold)
  + Added support for 6 button pad.

  Changes in Cyclone 0.0083wip:
  + Added missing CHK opcode (used by SeaQuest DSV).
  + Added missing TAS opcode (Gargoyles). As in real genesis, write-back phase
    is ignored (but is enabled for other systems).

  Backported stuff from Snes9x:
  * Fixed Pxxx jog up/down which were not working in game.
  + Added an option to gzip save states to save space.
  + The emulator now pauses whenever it is loosing focus, so it will now pause
    when alarm/ponecall/battery low/... windows come up.
  - Removed 'pause on phonecall' feature, as it is no longer needed.
  + Video fix for asian A1000s.

0.70
  * Started using tools from "Symbian GCC Improvement Project", which give
    considerable speed increase (~4fps in "center 90" mode).
  * Rewrote some drawing routines in ARM assembly (gives ~6 more fps in
    "center 90" mode).
  * Minor improvement to 0 and 180 "fit" modes. Now they look slightly better
    and are faster.
  * Minor stability improvements (emulator is less likely to crash).
  + Added some background for OSD text for better readability.
  + Added Pal/NTSC detection. This is needed for proper sound speed.
  + Implemented Reesy's DrZ80 Z80 emu. Made some changes to it with hope to make
    it faster.
  + Implemented ym2612 emu from the MAME project. Runs well but sometimes sounds
    a bit weird. Could be a little faster, so made some changes too.
  + Implemented SN76489 emu from the MAME project.
  + Added two separate sound output methods (mediaserver and cmaudiofb) with
    autodetection (needs testing).
  * Fixed VDP DMA fill emulation (as described in Charles MacDonald's docs),
    fixes Contra and some other games.

0.301
  Launcher:
  * Launcher now starts emulation process from current directory,
    not from hardcoded paths.
  * Improved 'pause on call' feature, should hopefully work with Motorola phones.

0.30 (2006-01-07)
  Initial release based on fDave's code.
